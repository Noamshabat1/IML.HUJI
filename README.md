### üõ† Setting Up with Anaconda  

1. **Install Anaconda**:  
   Download and install Anaconda from the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).  

2. **Verify Installation**:  
   Open the Anaconda Prompt. You should see `(base)` at the start of the command line.  

3. **Create the Conda Environment**:  
   Run the following command in the Anaconda Prompt:  
   ```bash
   conda env create -f "LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH/environment.yml"  
   ```  
   If you see `ResolvePackageNotFound: plotly-orca`, remove the `plotly-orca` line from `environment.yml` and rerun the command. Then, install it manually:  
   ```bash
   conda install -c plotly plotly-orca  
   ```  

4. **Activate the Environment**:  
   ```bash
   conda activate iml.env  
   ```  

5. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**:  
   Open a lab notebook, for example:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "LOCAL_REPOSITORY_PATH/lab/Lab 00 - A - Data Analysis In Python - First Steps.ipynb"  
   ```
